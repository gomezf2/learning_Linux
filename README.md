# Learning Linux — Notes and Hands‑On Exercises

This repository documents my structured Linux learning journey as I build the foundations required for modern DevOps engineering.  
My focus is on understanding Linux from first principles, practising commands hands‑on, and developing consistent habits around documentation and problem‑solving.

## Why I'm Learning Linux

Linux is at the core of cloud platforms, automation tools, CI/CD systems, and container technologies.  
As I work toward becoming a DevOps engineer, I’m using this repo to:

- strengthen my command‑line fluency  
- understand how Linux systems behave under the hood  
- practise real-world tasks through exercises  
- build a reliable foundation for future tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines  

This repo is a record of what I’ve learned and applied not a rewrite of a textbook.

## What This Repo Contains

- **Chapter-based notes** written in my own words  
- **Exercises** that demonstrate practical understanding  
- **Miscellaneous notes** for commands, troubleshooting, and deeper exploration  

Everything here reflects real progress as I work through the material.

## Current Progress

I’m currently working through chapters 3–7, focusing on:

- navigating the filesystem  
- understanding permissions and ownership  
- managing users and groups  
- working with processes and system monitoring  
- exploring essential command-line tools  

Each chapter includes both notes and exercises to reinforce the concepts.

## Future Plans

- Continue progressing through the remaining chapters  
- Add more real-world Linux scenarios and troubleshooting notes  
- Expand into scripting and automation  
- Build additional repos for YAML, GitHub Actions, Docker, and monitoring tools

## Closing Thoughts

This repository is a snapshot of my growth both in Linux fundamentals and in the habits required for DevOps engineering.  
It reflects consistency, structure, and a commitment to learning through doing.
