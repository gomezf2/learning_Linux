1. Create a script in your $HOME/bin directory called myownscript. When the script
runs, it should output information that appears as follows:
Today is Sat Jan 4 15:45:04 EST 2020.
You are in /home/joe and your host is abc.example.com.
Of course, you need to read in your current date/time, current working directory,
and hostname. Also, include comments about what the script does and indicate
that the script should run with the /bin/bash shell.


2. Create a script that reads in three positional parameters from the command line,
assigns those parameters to variables named ONE, TWO, and THREE, respectively,
and outputs that information in the following format:
There are X parameters that include Y.
The first is A, the second is B, the third is C.
Replace X with the number of parameters and Y with all parameters entered. Then
replace A with the contents of variable ONE, B with variable TWO, and C with vari-
able THREE.

3. Create a script that prompts users for the name of the street and town where they
grew up. Assign town and street to variables called mytown and mystreet, and
output them with a sentence that reads as shown below (of course, $mystreet and
$mytown will appear with the actual town and street the user enters):
The street I grew up on was $mystreet and the town was
$mytown

4. Create a script called myos that asks the user, “What is your favorite operating
system?” Output an insulting sentence if the user types “Windows” or “Mac.”
Respond “Great choice!” if the user types “Linux.” For anything else, say “Is <what
is typed in> an operating system?”
5. Create a script that runs through the words moose, cow, goose, and sow through a
for loop. Have each of those words appended to the end of the line “I have a. . . .”
