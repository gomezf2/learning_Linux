1. Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects directory, create nine empty fi les that are named house1, house2, house3, and so on to house9. Assuming there are lots of other fi les in that directory, come up with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine files. 

2. Make the $HOME/projects/houses/doors/ directory path. Create the following empty files within this directory path (try using absolute and relative paths from your home directory): $HOME/projects/houses/bungalow.txt $HOME/projects/houses/doors/bifold.txt $HOME/projects/outdoors/vegetation/landscape.txt 

3. Copy the fi les house1 and house5 to the $HOME/projects/houses/ directory. 

4. Recursively copy the /usr/share/doc/initscripts* directory to the $HOME/ projects/ directory. Maintain the current date/time stamps and permissions. 

5. Recursively list the contents of the $HOME/projects/ directory. Pipe the output to the less command so you can page through the output. 

6. Remove the fi les house6, house7, and house8 without being prompted. 

7. Move house3 and house4 to the $HOME/projects/houses/doors directory. 

8. Remove the $HOME/projects/houses/doors directory and its contents. 

9. Change the permissions on the $HOME/projects/house2 fi le so it can be read and written by the user who owns the file, only read by the group, and have no permission for others. 

10. Recursively change permissions of the $HOME/projects/ directory so nobody has write permission to any fi les or directory beneath that point in the fi lesystem.
