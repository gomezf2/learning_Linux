1. Copy the /etc/services fi le to the /tmp directory. Open the /tmp/services file in vim, and search for the term WorldWideWeb. Change that to read World Wide Web. 

2. Find the following paragraph in your /tmp/services fi le (if it is not there, choose a different paragraph) , and move it to the end of that fi le. # Note that it is presently the policy of IANA to assign a single well-known # port number for both TCP and UDP; hence, most entries here have two entries # even if the protocol doesn't support UDP operations. # Updated from RFC 1700, "Assigned Numbers" (October 1994). Not all ports # are included, only the more common ones. 

3. Using ex mode, search for every occurrence of the term tcp (case-sensitive) in your /tmp/services fi le and change it to WHATEVER. 

4. As a regular user, search the /etc directory for every file named passwd. Redirect error messages from your search to /dev/null. 

5. Create a directory in your home directory called TEST. Create fi les in that directory named one, two, and three that have full read/write/execute permissions on for everyone (user, group, and other). Construct a find command to find those fi les and any other fi les that have write permission open to “others” from your home directory and below.

6. Find fi les under the /usr/share/doc directory that have not been modified in more than 300 days. 

7. Create a /tmp/FILES directory. Find all fi les under the /usr/share directory that are more than 5MB and less than 10MB and copy them to the /tmp/FILES directory. 

8. Find every fi le in the /tmp/FILES directory, and make a backup copy of each fi le in the same directory. Use each file’s existing name, and just append .mybackup to create each backup file. 

9. Install the kernel-doc package in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Using grep, search inside the files contained in the /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc* directory for the term e1000 (case-insensitive) and list the names of the fi les that contain that term. 

10. Search for the e1000 term again in the same location, but this time list every line that contains the term and highlight the term in colour
